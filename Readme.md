This workbook contains a compilation of the steps used to set up and run basic examples of Rhodium (as part of Project Platypus), MOEA_Borg (David Hadka) and the DPS_Lake_Problem (Julianne Quinn).

This workbook is meant to be used as a guide to set up and run these examples locally or on a HPC system as a first step to getting started understanding and adapting to the MORDM framework. This work book is a work in progeres and is ever evolving and growing with updtase as I learn.

I do not own nor did I created any of these models I am simply learning and compling for a more streamlined workflow. All credit gotes to the original creators of these Frameworks.
